# Moving Boxes

## Description

This project is a simple repo that involves moving boxes between two containers. There are two buttons, "Move to Left" and "Move to Right". When the "Move to Left" button is clicked, a box is moved from the right black container to the left black container. Similarly, when the "Move to Right" button is clicked, a box is moved from the left black container to the right black container.
